The code works given these inputs: ambient temperature, height and weight.
Firstly, the fit tracker registers data from various sensors placed on nowadays smartphone, such as 3-axis accelerations, altitude, longitude and latitude with respect to the intersect between greenwich meridian and the equator, speed.

Then the code proceeds to calculate the distance, the average slope and the consumed oxygen volume.
Output values are burnt kilocalories, average oxygen volume, geolocalization, liquid loss during the activity and steps taken.
